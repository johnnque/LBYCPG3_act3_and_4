                    The <b>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model</b> 
                    acts as a framework that explains how different computer systems 
                    communicate and transfer data to each other. Developed by the 
                    International Organization for Standardization (ISO), it consists 
                    of seven layers, each with specific tasks and responsibilities.

            <h2>The 7 Layers of the OSI Model</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Application Layer (Layer 7)</b> – Creates the data to be transferred.</li>
                <li><b>Presentation Layer (Layer 6)</b> – Formats, encrypts, and compresses data.</li>
                <li><b>Session Layer (Layer 5)</b> – Establishes, manages, and terminates connections.</li>
                <li><b>Transport Layer (Layer 4)</b> – Breaks data into segments for reliable delivery.</li>
                <li><b>Network Layer (Layer 3)</b> – Breaks segments into packets and handles routing.</li>
                <li><b>Data Link Layer (Layer 2)</b> – Converts packets into frames for transmission.</li>
                <li><b>Physical Layer (Layer 1)</b> – Transmits raw bits through physical media.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 onclick=toggleDisplay(event)>1. Encapsulation and Data Flow ▼</h2>

            <p class="toggleable">
                The OSI layers are numbered from bottom to top, with the Physical Layer 
                as Layer 1 and the Application Layer as Layer 7.
                <br>
                When data is sent, it starts at the Application Layer and travels 
                downward through the layers. At each layer, additional information 
                (headers) is added — a process known as <b>encapsulation</b>. 
                These headers help identify the destination and manage communication.
                <br>
                When the data reaches the receiving device, the process is reversed. 
                The data moves upward through the layers, and each layer removes its 
                corresponding header — a process called <b>decapsulation</b>.
                <br>
                Each layer acts as a checkpoint in the communication process. No layer 
                can be skipped, and a failure in any layer may cause communication issues.

            <h2 onclick=toggleDisplay(event)>2. Protocols and Examples Per Layer ▼</h2>

            <p class="toggleable">
                The OSI Model uses different protocols at each layer to ensure proper
                communication between devices
                <br>
                The <b>Application Layer</b> uses protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP and DNS 
                which is used for web browsing, file transfer, and email services
                <br>
                The <b>Presentation Layer</b> handles the encryption and formatting through
                SSL/TLS and data formats like JPEG or MPEG
                <br>
                The <b>Session Layer</b> manages connections using protocols like NetBIOS and 
                RPC.
                <br>
                The <b>Transport Layer</b> ensures delivery through TCP (reliable) and 
                UDP (faster but connectionless). 
                <br>
                The <b>Network Layer</b> routes data using IP and ICMP.
                <br>
                The <b>Data Link Layer</b> manages physical addressing through Ethernet and ARP
                <br>
                The <b>Physical Layer</b> transmit raw data using cables, fiber optics, or 
                wireless signals
