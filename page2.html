                    The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, TCP/IP, model is a practical framework as opposed to OSI's theoretical model. 
                    It was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and consists of 4 layers

            <h2>The TCP/IP Model is divided into 4 distinct layers:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Application Layer (Layer 1)</b> – Serves as the user's interface to communicate through the network.</li>
                <li><b>Transport Layer (Layer 2)</b> – Handles data flow and error checking.</li>
                <li><b>Internet Layer (Layer 3)</b> – Involved in logical addressing and routing of payloads.</li>
                <li><b>Network Access Layer (Layer 4)</b> – Facilitates physical movement of data over the network medium.</li>
            </ul>

                The TCP/IP has 4 layers which is traveresed by data as it is processed. 
                Data typically moves from the Application Layer down to the Network Access layer, 
                where headers are appeneded for transmission. The receiver removes these headers as the 
                data moves from bottom to top
